False,Fresh,B-,"This all winds up being mindless fun with a couple of over-the-top comedic performances from Jack Black and Jason Momoa as well as a fun, visually immersive world that really springs to life on the big screen."
False,Rotten,C-,"Based on the famous game, “A Minecraft Movie” attempts to recreate the message about the limitless power of imagination. [Full Review in Spanish]"
True,Rotten,1/5,"The villain, a piglin called Malgosha who hates creativity and is obsessed with hoarding wealth, provides an inadvertently neat allegory for the studio bosses who greenlit this egregious IP cash-in."
True,Fresh,4/5,"While it may not be a masterpiece, its sheer sense of fun make it an easy win for families looking for something to watch during the holidays."
False,Fresh,7/10,"While A Minecraft Movie doesn't seek to revolutionize cinema, it does demonstrate a clear understanding of its source material and how to exploit it to deliver a product that fulfills its purpose: providing a fun, enjoyable time."
False,Rotten,2.5/5,Not even the energetic comedy chemistry between Jack Black and Jason Momoa can makeup for the surprisingly uninspired story and pretty boring characters.
False,Fresh,3.5/5,"A noisy, funny, good-natured mess of a film."
False,Fresh,B-,"There are a few meta-gripes that could be made, but mostly A Minecraft Movie appears to faithfully serve its target audience."
False,Fresh,7/10,"""A Minecraft Movie"" is a broad, slapstick farce without a hint of seriousness, reverence, or coolness. The most shocking thing? It's not terrible. "
False,Rotten,2/4,"...A Minecraft Movie never finds its groove, constantly veering from one set-piece to another with a scattershot storyline and whiplash-inducing tone inconsistencies."
True,Rotten,2/4,the jumble of tones and styles laid atop this basic narrative feels like it’s trying to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one.
True,Fresh,B+,Just the right amount of newness and unpredictability is the true magic of Webb's Snow White.
False,Rotten,D+,The new songs are unmemorable and one of them is outright awful (Princess Problems).
False,Rotten,2.5/4,"Rachel Zegler is the best part of the live-action remake. Gal Gadot is a bit stiff, and the songs are hit-and-miss. The movie looks spectacular and is best suited for families with young kids."
False,Rotten,5/10,Somewhere between the animated version and the true life version the Disney magic was lost.
False,Fresh,3.5/5,"This remake, which admittedly has its own problems, improves on some of the issues in the original, mostly by making its main characters actual characters with depth and emotion and all the things that make them engaging and interesting."
False,Rotten,C,"It does the exactly what we want these remakes to do in expanding on its predecessor...there are some things to like, it just doesn't get there in execution."
False,Rotten,4/10,Disney is having an identity crisis that has trickled down to its ability to update its best-loved fairy tales into modern remakes.
False,Rotten,D,Disney has lost sight of why they started doing animation in the first place: because there's just some things you shouldn't do in live action.
False,Rotten,C-,Zegler is the only thing keeping Snow White from becoming the on-screen debacle that it already is off-screen. A colossal screw up at virtually every level.
True,Fresh,3/4,Action scenes pop up frequently enough to keep the most fidgety teen engaged.
True,Rotten,2.5/5,It feels as if Sam is merely the guest star in someone’s else story in this particular chapter of the MCU’s interwoven narrative.
False,Rotten,1.5/5,"The worst part about Captain America: Brave New World is that it merely exists. Apart from its nostalgic roots, this “new” direction is more of the same just with actors and characters that aren’t nearly as interesting as they think they are."
False,Fresh,3/4,"It tries a little too hard to get things moving in the first act, and it does feel fairly slight overall, a Minor Marvel. But for the majority of its running time, it soars, largely thanks to Anthony Mackie's potent presence."
False,Rotten,C,I had moderately high hopes with Iger back in the fold but this is a confounding experience from pitch to execution. There will likely be worse superhero movies this year but this will likely stand out as one of the more disappointing efforts.
False,Rotten,1/5,"As a major motion picture, CA:BNW is a non-entity, deceptively non-sensical in its spackled, empty-headed narrative. It's unclear what the film is attempting to say other than suggesting the necessity of embracing one's own strengths AND weaknesses."
False,Fresh,3/5,"Cap IV is a... hammer, good for little more than hitting things until all the things are hit. It is not about finesse, or sculpting something beautiful. It just hits, in unsubtle but effective ways, until all the nails have been hammered home."
False,Fresh,6.5/10,It is pretty entertaining – and also nice to see Mackie and Ford with roles they seem to enjoy – it’s also dangerously close in quality to being a direct to streaming viewing rather than a big family IMAX outing.
False,Rotten,D,There's no excuse for this to be this poorly executed.
False,Rotten,1.5/5,"A plot without something to say is directionless, and characters without a point of view are doomed to remain one-dimensional. The simple fact is, you can’t make a political thriller devoid of political commentary..."
True,Fresh,3/4,Young audiences will have fun following the likable characters and their perilous adventures.
True,Rotten,2.5/5,"The director keeps a firm if predictable hand on the tiller – the action scenes, such as lions trapped in that flooded river and an elephant stampede – are impressive but the script is limp."
False,Rotten,2/5,"The circle of life flatlines in this mundane, redundant Lion King prequel which sacrifices charm, heart, and comedy in the pursuit of vanguard visuals."
False,Rotten,1/5,The prequel to one of the most aesthetically barren major films of the last ten years was always going to have a pretty hard time being anything but aesthetically barren in its own right.
False,Rotten,6/10,"Please, PLEASE stop making entire sequels, prequels, remakes and reboots to 'address' things that only YouTube video essayists ever (sort-of) cared about a decade ago."
False,Fresh,C+,"The story is filled with romance and adventures on high cliffs, mountains, in caves, and in a far, fair land. It is in a form called photo realistic animation. It doesn't exactly look real, but it is close, thanks to state of the art digital animation."
False,Fresh,3/5,...the biggest letdown of the film is that it just brushes through the characters without exploring the emotional dynamics and depth. Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa is enjoyable but nowhere close to The Lion King.
False,Fresh,4/5,"The Hindi dub of Mufasa: The Lion King, at first flush, represents an improbable marriage. But it is one that is made in heaven."
False,Fresh,B,"I'm not a fan of these live action updates, but I really did like this one."
False,Fresh,3/5,"This addition to the Lion King franchise maintains a more than satisfactory standard in all its aspects, but at the same time it feels quite artificial and calculated."
True,Fresh,3/4,It’s this unembellished emotional simplicity that makes the continued tales of Paddington so wonderful. It is also what makes them essential.
True,Rotten,1/4,Dougal Wilson is not the problem. Rather it is the disastrous screenplay by three people who should know better.
False,Rotten,2/5,"Outside of Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas' performances, I was not a fan. The Paddington character has actually gotten worse."
False,Fresh,4/5,I quite enjoyed this. It's not as fun or insane as Paddington 2 but there's enough charm here to make this an entertaining watch.
False,Fresh,6/10,"Threequels, ugh."
False,Fresh,4/5,You are in a comfort zone and it is only you and the bear with a generous smile. Enjoy.
False,Fresh,B,"This series has officially become the ""Toy Story"" of anthropomorphic talking bear movies."
False,Fresh,B,"It's not as great as its predecessors, but it's still remarkably charming and fun."
False,Rotten,4/10,So slow it was almost un-bear-able.
False,Rotten,1/4,"The whole film is exhausting: boring, interminable lore-telling intercut with elaborate set-pieces showcasing Paddington’s clumsiness and cupidity."
True,Rotten,1/4,One of the most ill-conceived sequels in Disney history.
True,Fresh,3/5,The animation is impressive. This is an easy film to watch.
False,Fresh,3/5,"""Moana 2"" is fine. It’s neither great nor horrible, it just provides a comfortable adventure that follows the well-tread path created by the initial outing."
False,Fresh,3.5/4,"With a score of new songs, the voice cast, led beautifully by Cravalho, captures the doubt and determination Moana feels as she’s called to follow this epic quest."
False,Rotten,1/5,"Moana 2 somehow feels like a three-hour film crammed into an hour and 40 minutes. The animation is disappointing, the story is stretched well beyond its means, and the music is pure trash."
False,Fresh,3/5,The enjoyment [of the film]… is much more connected to the visual presentation than to a plot that is followed with much more indifference than attention.
False,Fresh,2.5/4,"You can’t help but notice myriad little shortcomings, which may be attributable to the shift from series to film."
False,Rotten,2/5,There is at no point any real reason to care about what's happening or what the stakes are.
False,Fresh,6/10,"Good, not great. Where are the stand out songs?"
False,Fresh,2.5/4,Moana 2 does enough to fit the bill of solid family entertainment. It accomplishes the most important thing for any sequel: reunite the original characters with each other and the audience.
True,Fresh,3/4,"“Warfare” is a viscerally impressive work. Your body feels it. But you may come away from it wondering what the larger point is, other than the fact that it happened to someone."
True,Rotten,2/5,Doesn’t a film like Warfare – impressively brutal and bloody as it is – functionally reduce combat to a Call of Duty cut scene if it refuses to engage with the why and how of it all?
False,Fresh,B,“Warfare” doesn’t just depict combat—it traps you inside.
False,Rotten,2.5/5,"You half expect Garland, Mendoza, and the cast to march on screen and start singing: “Who’s the leader of the club that’s made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y, M-O-U-S-E! Forever let us hold our banner high! High! High! High!”"
False,Fresh,3/5,"Garland and Mendoza’s cinema of pure shock and awe takes hold of audiences with a relentless death grip... [but] Warfare finds itself sharing much in common with a slick piece of propaganda, depoliticizing something inherently political."
False,Fresh,4/4,Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza assault your senses with a 95-minute immersive experience that places you in the combat zone as a member of the Alpha One Navy SEAL team. Extraordinary.
False,Fresh,5/5,"There’s a real-time authenticity here underscored by first-rate performances, visceral action sequences, and a sound design that rattles you just like the warriors on screen. Caution: This one’s not for the squeamish."
False,Fresh,A,"“Warfare” may stay with you long afterward, but it’s kind of cathartic in its own strange way, like something you have to see to believe, and having seen it, wish it never had to happen to anyone. Ever."
False,Fresh,B,"It is redundant to every wartime reflection, in that it shows armed conflict to be stupid, senseless, and bad... But with its whole chest, it says “This is how a group of dudes in an awful situation remember that awful situation.”"
False,Fresh,4/5,"Based on memories of the actual SEALs involved, this hyper-violent, naturalistic portrayal of combat couldn't spring authentically from a civilian filmmaker."
True,Fresh,4/5,"The film, shot in oily gloom by Nico Aguilar, sets out to dispatch every passerby in fashions that would appal Caligula. Good old-fashioned disgusting fun. I had a blast."
True,Rotten,2/5,"Perkins’s film never explains how the monkey migrates so much, but follows it from pillar to post on an equal-opportunity killing spree. As spectacle, it’s garish."
False,Fresh,3/5,"In a break from his quietly moody horror movies, filmmaker Osgood Perkins embraces strange, cockeyed humor and gleefully excessive gore for this inventive yet odd Stephen King adaptation."
False,Fresh,4/5,"Give us a dozen The Monkey sequels with more trippy nightmare sequences, unnerving death stares from the shadows, and unhinged music cues that are so loud they crumble part of your soul. Unpredictable. Crazy gore. Absurd. This is a potential franchise."
False,Fresh,A-,"Perkins doesn’t let the plot’s twists and turns get in the way of the fun. At the same time, he remembers that there need to be genuine scares, and he conjures an ominous mood."
False,Rotten,2/5,Perkins seems more interested in formulating a mirage of monkey shines in this tonally uneven take on a noted Stephen King short story which manages only to succeed in overwhelming not one but two vacuous characterizations played by Theo James..
False,Rotten,2/4,"Despite its proficient execution, The Monkey struggles to find the right balance between the absurdity of its premise and the seriousness of its main themes. "
False,Fresh,6/10,"This ""Monkey"" shines by being scary and funny."
False,Rotten,5/10,This one has all of the right elements but goes extreme horror comedy and away from the more highbrow horror of Longlegs. It’s really dark all the way to the last moment and may not be for everyone but gorehounds will probably eat this up.
False,Fresh,3/5,The Monkey' has some beautiful death scenes that benefit from Oz Perkins' disturbing aesthetic. It also has surprise cameos that keep horror kids on their toes.
True,Fresh,5/5,"The world of Flow, like those of the best movies, is hallucinatory and its mood hypnotic, the rolling, seductive frames adding to the illusion of some powerful subconscious truth."
True,Fresh,3/5,"Flow shows both formidable technical brilliance and ingenuity, not least because it dispenses with dialogue — quizzical mews, chirrups and rhythmic doggy breaths replacing words."
False,Fresh,4/5,A visual breath of fresh air and delightful respite from reality.
False,Fresh,4/4,"a marvel of technical ingenuity, formal beauty, and deep reverence for life"
False,Fresh,4/4,It's an amazing accomplishment that rivals the animals' journey every step of the way.
False,Fresh,4/5,"What surely won over Oscar voters, though, is the dreamy animation, with colourful fishes, majestic buildings and a sky filled with stars."
False,Fresh,5/5,"Eschewing dialogue and any hint of anthropomorphism, the film’s painterly, DIY approach is thoroughly enchanting, liable to hold audiences rapt if they’re six or 60."
False,Fresh,4/5,"Animation purists, and their pets, will love it."
False,Fresh,5/5,"Emotional without succumbing fully to darkness, Flow is a masterful example of what animation can do when viewed from a different perspective. Following an award season fraught with debate, there’s no denying this gorgeous film its victory."
False,Fresh,4.5/5,"Flow is one of the most visually arresting films I have seen. As with the very best cinema though, its images continue to enhance its themes."
True,Fresh,B+,"""Wallis Island"" explores themes of creativity, grieving and the passage of time with empathy and compassion without ever becoming maudlin."
True,Fresh,4/5,"Under the gentle hand of Griffiths, The Ballad of Wallis Island is both hilarious and delicate, never even making the buffoonish Charles simply a figure of mockery."
False,Fresh,7/10,The low-key approach and winning performances meld well with the heartfelt narrative.
False,Fresh,3.5/4,The Ballad of Wallis Island possesses the kind of heart not often seen in films these days.
False,Fresh,4/5,The melodic tones compliment a relatable tale of love and loss that's packed with quite a few endearing laughs in what feels like a spiritual successor in tone to the cult favorite Once.
False,Fresh,A,"This feature-length remake of a charming 2007 short film tells of a self-obsessed, slightly has-been-ish musician who arrives on a remote island to play a gig for one well-heeled fan. Then his ex-partner arrives too. British cringe comedy at its best."
False,Fresh,B,A breezy film that rescues a ridiculous premise with some unexpected heart-warming moments.
False,Fresh,2.5/4,"The movie's a low-key charmer that promises more than it delivers, but what it delivers is nice enough."
False,Fresh,8/10,"The Ballad of Wallis Island is a film about grief and acceptance in romantic-comedy drama clothes. Its message, bittersweet as it is in parts, is hopeful, joyous and ultimately empowering."
False,Fresh,B,"A genial, understated, warmhearted fish-out-of-water story...as charming and quirky as the short was, if a bit overextended."
